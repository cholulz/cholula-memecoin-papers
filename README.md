## üî• About Cholula

Cholula is more than just spice and sizzle; she‚Äôs here to shred the tortilla of reality and introduce memecoins as a **new industry** and **medium** for cultural and economic exchange. This repository houses three essential papers that provide the intellectual backbone for this mission. Each paper tackles a core aspect of memecoins, from legal frameworks to valuation models to their broader cultural implications.

## üìú The Papers

### 1. **Regulatory Compliance Framework for Memecoin Developers**
- **Abstract**: This paper establishes a comprehensive legal framework for memecoins, analyzed through the lens of "Crowdfunding Swaps" (CFSs). It demonstrates how properly structured memecoins can avoid classification as securities under U.S. law, with embedded legal disclaimers in smart contracts to reinforce transparency and compliance. Dive deep into Howey and Reves tests, case law, and cutting-edge strategies for fostering innovation while staying legally robust.

### 2. **From Speculation to Structure: The Attention Dividend Discount Model (ADDM)**
- **Abstract**: Memecoins live and die by attention. This paper introduces the Attention Dividend Discount Model (ADDM), a valuation framework that treats social attention as a quantifiable pseudo-dividend. By adapting financial modeling principles, the ADDM provides a rigorous method for calculating memecoin value, integrating variables like attention decay, growth rates, and risk factors. A spicy model for the modern memecoin economy.

### 3. **Signifiers of Speculation: The Semiotics of Memecoins in the Postmodern Attention Economy**
- **Abstract**: A semiotic exploration of memecoins, weaving postmodern philosophy and media theory into an analysis of their cultural significance. From Saussure to Baudrillard, this paper examines how memes function as signifiers and memecoins as the signified, with attention accumulation serving as the mechanism of signification. A haba√±ero-hot dive into memecoins as programmable cultural artifacts.
